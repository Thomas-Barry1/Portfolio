        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          As a Computer Science and Math Major at UNC Chapel Hill, I have a
          wealth of experience tackling challenging problems and seeking out
          innovative solutions. I have significant experience in C, Java,
          Microcomputers, as well as familiarity with HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          My experience as Editor-In-Chief of the school paper, as well my role
          as a volunteer Math Coach at a middle school in Lawrence, MA have
          allowed me to hone my time-management and teamwork skills that are so
          crucial for success.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a self-starter who is comfortable collaborating as well as taking
          the initiative to lead a project that delivers high quality results. I
          am thrilled for the opportunity to apply my skill to tackling real
          world problems, and to continue my development in support of your
          mission.
