        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          As a Computer Science major at The University of North Carolina at
          Chapel Hill, graduating in December of 2023, I have a wealth of
          experience solving challenging data structure problems and following
          OOP best practices. Through my position as a private tutor for Wyzant,
          a premier online tutoring platform, I have honed my technical
          expertise by teaching students advanced coding concepts and tackling
          their unique programming assignments.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a self-starter who is comfortable collaborating as well as taking
          the initiative to lead a project that delivers high quality results.
          My communication and collaborative skills have improved greatly as I
          have had to work with and explain challenging concepts to students,
          and lead teams inside and outside class to finish our projects.
