        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          As a DevOps Engineer with a strong focus on automation and
          infrastructure as code (IAC), I have successfully deployed solutions
          that enhance security, efficiency, and scalability. I take pride in
          designing and implementing systems that streamline workflows while
          improving product performance. For instance, I recently led the
          deployment of an antivirus scanning solution with a 100% scan success
          rate, iteratively improving the process to reduce scan time by 90x.
          These improvements ensured faster, more secure operations while
          meeting stringent security protocols.
        </p>
        <p>
          I excel at tackling complex cloud-architected environments,
          modernizing them with best practices in DevOps. One of my recent
          projects involved transforming a poorly coded website by transitioning
          it to Terraform, modularizing the code, and enhancing the user
          experience. The result was not only a vastly improved UI/UX but also
          highly positive feedback from users. My expertise in AWS services,
          combined with tools like Docker and Python, allows me to deliver
          high-performance solutions that scale efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my professional experience, I actively explore personal
          projects that drive my passion for full-stack development and AI. I
          built an AI-driven application designed to assist teachers with
          tailored lesson planning, using cutting-edge technologies like Angular
          and NodeJS. This hands-on experience complements my DevOps expertise
          and reflects my commitment to continuous learning and innovation in
          the field.
